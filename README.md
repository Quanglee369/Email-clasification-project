# Email-clasification-project
In this project I will build a classification model that predict whether an email to be spam or non-spam. This is done by traning and testing the model with data of 83448 different emails.
Throughout the project I have done many steps which include:
- Preprocessing data:
  + Remove stop words, punctuation
  + Tokenizer the text data
  + Turn the tokenized data into padding sequence
- Choose the best model and tunning parameters:
  + Go through well know model for email classification such as (Random Forest, GRU, RNN)
Tunning parameters to come up with the most optimal result for that model
